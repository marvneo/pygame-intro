# Snail Hunter

Hi! This is a game I made using pygame. The goal of the game is simple, rack up as many points as you can by using your space key to avoid enemies. Use the "Escape" button on your keyboard to pause the game.

Game assets are taken from [here(art)](https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-pixel-edition) and [here(music)](https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action).
